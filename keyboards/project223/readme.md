# Project223

![project223](imgur.com image replace me!)

This ortholinear handwired keyboard was made as a final project for Harvard's Physics 223: Electronics for Scientists. The default layout is incredibly personalized, to the point that it's probably not useful for most people. But it does feature an entire layer dedicated to emoji.
